## About the TiDB Incubator Program <img src="https://download.pingcap.com/community-devgroup/event-TiDB-Incubator-Program.svg" style="width:400px;float:right;margin-left:20px">
[TiDB Incubator Program](https://github.com/pingcap/community/tree/master/incubator) is designed to ensure that new projects have correct licensing, up-to-date boilerplate documents, a healthy community process, and are developed using accepted TiDB Community practices.

The  [TiDB community](https://github.com/pingcap/community)  is composed of developers, users, and partners in the TiDB ecosystem, and we’re dedicated to building “the database of the future” and the sustainable ecosystem for it. With the continued efforts, love, and support from the entire community, the TiDB ecosystem continues to evolve. More and more open source projects are now part of the great TiDB family, such as  [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) , the open-source distributed transaction Key-Value database,  [Weir](https://github.com/tidb-incubator/weir) , the service-oriented TiDB database management platform, and  [TiBigData](https://github.com/tidb-incubator/TiBigData) , the bigdata component used to link TiDB and Apache Flink.

In the future, more projects will sprout, grow, mature, and even develop into independent projects in the TiDB community. To help these projects obtain more resources and help from the community, we started the TiDB Incubator Program.

## Projects Incubation Process
If you want to incubate a new project on [TiDB Incubator Graduated](https://github.com/tidb-incubator-graduated) organization and designed to extend one or more [TiDB Incubator Graduated](https://github.com/tidb-incubator-graduated) projects with functionality, please follow [Projects Incubation Process](#projects-incubation-process).

## Some projects currently in incubation
[TiBigData](https://github.com/tidb-incubator/TiBigData)  is an incubating project initiated by Zhihu. Its goal is to integrate TiDB and various technology stacks more easily in enterprise big data scenarios. Currently, the integration capability of TiDB with Flink and Presto has been completed, and it has been applied to Zhihu’s data integration platform and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) analysis scenarios.

> “Zhihu may have initiated the TiBigData project, but it belongs to the entire TiDB community. We hope it benefits users with similar needs in the community. We also hope to mobilize the power of the community to complement TiDB’s capabilities in various big data technology stacks and build TiBigData as a one-stop big data solution for TiDB.”  
> —— Sun Xiaoguang, Chairman of the TiDB Community Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)  

[Weir](https://github.com/tidb-incubator/weir)  is a distributed database-oriented middleware platform initiated by Palfish. It has completed MySQL protocol support, multi-tenant management, connection pooling, back-end load balancing, configuration hot loading, platform management, and other functions. Palfish has begun to promote internal business access.

> “Participating in the TiDB Incubator Program can quickly find like-minded friends, and efficiently share ideas and collaborate. This makes open source easier and more fun.”  
> —— Chen Xianlin, the TiDB Community TOC member and the head of Palfish Technology Center.
